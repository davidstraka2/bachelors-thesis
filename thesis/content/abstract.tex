This thesis deals with the design, implementation, and testing of an extension of the Atom editor for streamlining the
creation of WooWoo documents. Emphasis is put especially on clear presentation of the logical structure of documents
using the existing templates. Familiarization with the WooWoo format, research of the possibilities of the extension of
current editors and possibilities of displaying mathematical expressions and different graphic objects are all also part
of the thesis.
